In this repo are the files and instructions associated with the TI-84 KE as discussed here:

https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=289588


## Parts Included:
* PCB
* 52x Keycaps
* Stainless Steel Plate
* 3D Printed Case
* 3D Printed Bezel
* 10x M3 Bolts
* 2x Ribbon Cable Extenders
* Ribbon Cable Wire


## You Will Need:
* Sacrificial TI-84 CE (Instructions written based on Rev.N, non-Python)
* 52x MX-compatible keyswitches of your choice
* Soldering Iron and Solder
* Isopropal Alcohol & Q-tips
* T5 and T6 Torx Drivers
### Optional:
* Hot Glue
* Razor/Knife
* Patience


## Assembly Instructions:

#### Start off by disassembling you TI-84 CE:

Unscrew the battery cover and remove the battery. place the battery and battery cover to the side for future use.\
Unscrew the 6 screws around the rear poerimeter opf the calculator. Do not lose these screws. Keeps these screws for later use. On some models, there will also be screws under the battery, remove these as well.\
At this point, there should be no screw visible from the outside.\
Using an old hotel keycard or other thin plastic shim, pry the front and back halves of the calculator apart. Start from the bottom and work your way around the left (ON and Y= side), around the top of the screen, and then down towards the USB port on the right side. Angling your shim towards the front of the calculator may help.\
There will be a series of loud pops as you run your shim around the calculator. This is normal.\
Take care not to dig too deep with the shim, as you risk damaging the motherboard or screen.\
If the EMI shielding is able to be removed at this time, remove it.\
Using your fingernail or other small (not sharp) tool, release the ZIF connector that is retaining the screen's ribbon cable.\
Remove the 4 plastic rivets that are holding the motherboard in place. You can do this by putting a knifepoint or Philips head screwdriver in the middle of the rivet and twisting while applying moderate pressure.\
If the EMI shielding is still in place, it should be removable now.\
Remove the motherboard and screen from the front case.\
Using moderate pressure from the inside, push the clear screen cover out from the front case. There is adhesive holding this cover in place, but consistent pressure should release it slowly.

#### After dissasembly, you should be left with these parts:
* Battery
* Battery Cover
* Motherboard
* Screen
* Screen Cover
* 6x T6 screws

#### Next, Assemble the switch/PCB/plate stack:

Unscrew the steel plate from the base. Use a T5 driver to remove the 10 M3 bolts. Do not loose these bolts. Inside you will find the PCB.
If the switches you chose support LEDs from the bottom, and you want LEDs, solder the LEDs onto the PCB now, making sure of the orientation (long leg of the LED goes to the '+' sign on the PCB).
Take 6 of your keyswitches and snap them into the steel plate at the locations pictured below (At all the "corner" locations). The pins on the bottom of the switches should be facing towards the bottom (long) edge of the plate.
(INSERT IMAGE HERE)
Line the PCB up with the switch pins. If your switches are PCB-mount (5-pin), press the switches into the PCB until they sit flush. This may take more force than you expect. The pins of the switches should line up with the soplderable holes on the PCB.
With the plate/PCB/switch assemble laying face-down, ensure that the PCB is pushed or laying flush against the bottom of the switches. If you have LEDs installed, make sure they are aligned correctly.
Solder these first 6 switches into place.
Turning the PCB bakc face-up, insert the rest of the switches into place. Ensure that the pins on the switches are straight before attempting to put them in. There will be a distinct snap when the switch locks into the plate. If you have 5-pin switches, you may need to apply pressure from the PCB and squeeze the switch into place. Ensure that the switch bottoms are flush with the PCB, and that no switch sticks up highter than others.
Solder the rest of the switches in place. There are 2 solderpoints per switch. If you notice one of the switch pins got bent while inserting, you can remove the switch before soldering, straighten the pins, and insert again.
If your switches support LEDs from the top, and you want LEDs, push the LED legs through the switches and solder them now. Ensure they are and flush and "pushed down" as possible while soldering, as to avoid them interefering with the keycaps.

#### At this point, you should have a complete plate/PCB/switch assembly, with LEDs optionally installed.
